<h2 id="the-system">The system</h2>
<p>
  The first thing you need to do to use PluralKit is to set up a system! Each
  account can have one system, but you can link one system to multiple accounts.
  To inspect a system, you can pull up its <em>system card</em>. Below is an
  example system with all options set, which you can also see by typing
  <code class="highlighter-rouge">pk;system exmpl</code> on Discord:
  <img
    src="/assets/ExampleSystem.png"
    alt="Example of a filled out system card"
  />
</p>

<h3 id="parts-of-the-system">Parts of the system</h3>
<p>
  These are the parts of the system, reading the card top to bottom left to
  right like a book:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>System name</strong>: The system name is at the top of the system
    card. On the example system it is <strong>PluralKit Example System</strong>.
    System names are optional.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Avatar</strong>: This is the system avatar, it is an image that you
    can put on the system card.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Fronters</strong>: This shows who is currently registered as
    fronting using the
    <a href="/guide#managing-switches">switch tracking commands</a>.
    <a href="/guide#system-privacy">It can be hidden.</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Tag</strong>: This is the system tag, and it will be placed after
    the name of members on proxied messages.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Members</strong>: This is a member count, and you can use
    <code class="highlighter-rouge">pk;system list</code> to see a list of the
    members.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Description</strong>: This is the system description, and can be any
    text you wish to put on your system card.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>System ID</strong>: This is the auto-generated ID of the system. You
    can use this to refer to any system.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Created on</strong>: This is the time and date the system was
    created on.
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="creating-a-system">Creating a system</h3>
<p>
  You need a system to start creating members, but luckily this is simple! All
  you need to do is run
  <code class="highlighter-rouge">pk;system new [name]</code>. So if you wanted
  your system to be named ‚ÄúBoxes of Foxes‚Äù you would run the command
  <code class="highlighter-rouge">pk;system new Boxes of Foxes</code>! If you
  don‚Äôt want a name, you can use the command
  <code class="highlighter-rouge">pk;system new</code>, with no extra text. If
  you want to do tweak the system,
  <a href="/guide#system-management">see the user guide</a>! This page is just a
  simple setup guide.
</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="members">Members</h2>
<p>
  Once you have created a system, the next thing you need to get started is to
  create a member! Like before, here is an example of a full member card with
  all options used:
  <img
    src="/assets/ExampleMember.png"
    alt="Example of a filled out member card"
  />
</p>

<h3 id="parts-to-a-member">Parts to a member</h3>
<p>
  These are the parts of a member, reading the card top to bottom left to right
  like a book:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Name and system</strong>: This is the name of the member, in this
    case ‚ÄúMyriad‚Äù, and the system they are part of in brackets, in this case the
    ‚ÄúPluralKit Example System‚Äù.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Avatar</strong>: This is the image that‚Äôs used for proxying messages
    from this member.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Display name</strong>: This is shown in proxy messages on all
    servers in place of their name if it is set.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Server nickname</strong>: This is like display name, but set for
    specific servers (in this case the PluralKit support server).
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Birthdate</strong>: This is the member‚Äôs set birthday, it can be
    with or without the year.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Pronouns</strong>: This is the member‚Äôs pronouns. It‚Äôs a free text
    entry field, so you can put anything you‚Äôd like.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Message count</strong>: This is the total number of messages this
    member has ever sent through proxies.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Proxy tags</strong>: This is a list of the member‚Äôs proxy tags. We
    will go more in depth into them in a bit!
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Colour</strong>: This is the member‚Äôs colour, it affects the sidebar
    of the card on the left.
    <strong
      >It does not affect the proxy colour, due to a Discord limitation.</strong
    >
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Description</strong>: This is the member description. Similar to the
    system description, you can put anything you‚Äôd like here.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>System ID</strong>: This is the ID of the system this member is part
    of. In this case it‚Äôs the ID for the PluralKit Example System we saw above.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Member ID</strong>: This is the auto-generated ID for the member.
    You can always use this ID to refer to a specific member, even if the name
    contains hard-to-type characters.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Created on</strong>: This is the date and time the member was
    created.
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="creating-a-member">Creating a member</h3>
<p>
  This is just as easy as creating a system, but there are a few more things you
  will want to do immediately after. First you run
  <code class="highlighter-rouge">pk;member new &lt;name&gt;</code>, so if you
  want to create a member named Myriad, you would run
  <code class="highlighter-rouge">pk;member new Myriad</code>. Next, for
  proxying later, you will want to set an avatar for your new member! This is
  done simply by using
  <code class="highlighter-rouge"
    >pk;member &lt;member&gt; avatar &lt;link to avatar&gt;</code
  >. For example,
</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge">
  <div class="highlight">
    <pre
      class="highlight"
    ><code>pk;member Myriad avatar http://pluralkit.me/assets/myriad.png
</code></pre>
  </div>
</div>

<p>
  You can also leave out the image link, and instead attach an image with the
  command. That‚Äôll work too!
</p>

    >the member management section of the user guide</a
  >.

<h2 id="proxies">Proxies</h2>
<p>
  Proxies are probably the most important part of PluralKit, they are literally
  what the bot was made for. Below is an example of a proxied message:
</p>

<p><img src="/assets/ExampleProxy.png" alt="Example of a proxy message" /></p>

<h3 id="parts-to-a-proxy-message">Parts to a proxy message</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>The name</strong>: This is the member‚Äôs name, display name, or
    server nickname, depending on what‚Äôs set (server nickname overrides display
    name, which overrides the normal name). In this case, it‚Äôs
    <strong>Myriad ‚ÄúBig Boss‚Äù Kit</strong>.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>The system tag</strong>: If a system tag is set, this will will
    appear right after the name. In this case, it‚Äôs
    <strong>| PluralKit ü¶ä</strong>.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>The BOT badge</strong>: All proxies have this due to how the proxy
    service works. It‚Äôs not possible to remove.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>The message</strong>: The message you proxied through the bot - this
    is what was on the ‚Äúinside‚Äù of the proxy tags, which we will explain below.
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="parts-to-a-proxy-tag">Parts to a proxy tag</h3>
<p>
  A proxy tag is what tells PluralKit how to know to proxy a member. It looks
  like this:
</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge">
  <div class="highlight">
    <pre class="highlight"><code>pretextpost
</code></pre>
  </div>
</div>
<p>and has 3 parts.</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Prefix</strong>: In this case,
    <code class="highlighter-rouge">pre</code>. This tells PluralKit what to
    look for at the <strong>start</strong> of the message
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Separator</strong>: This is always the word
    <code class="highlighter-rouge">text</code>, all-lowercase. It tells
    PluralKit where the prefix ends and the suffix starts.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Suffix</strong>: In this case,
    <code class="highlighter-rouge">post</code>. This tells PluralKit to what to
    look for at the <strong>end</strong> of a message
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  You can imagine that this is an ‚Äúexample proxy‚Äù, where the intended message is
  the word <code class="highlighter-rouge">text</code>.
</p>

<p>In this example, typing a message such as</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge">
  <div class="highlight">
    <pre class="highlight"><code>pre This is an example message post
</code></pre>
  </div>
</div>
<p>would result in the message ‚ÄúThis is an example message‚Äù being proxied.</p>

<h3 id="setting-a-proxy-tag">Setting a proxy tag</h3>
<p>
  To set a proxy tag you need to know 3 things. The member you wish to set the
  tags for, the prefix for the tag, and the suffix for the tag. Once you know
  these things you can run the command:
</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge">
  <div class="highlight">
    <pre class="highlight"><code>pk;member [member] proxy [prefix]text[suffix]
</code></pre>
  </div>
</div>
<p>
  For example, if you want messages starting with
  <code class="highlighter-rouge">{</code> and ending with
  <code class="highlighter-rouge">}</code> to be proxied by Myriad, you could
  run
</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge">
  <div class="highlight">
    <pre class="highlight"><code>pk;member Myriad proxy {text}
</code></pre>
  </div>
</div>
<p>
  Now when you type a message such as
  <code class="highlighter-rouge">{this is an example message}</code> it will be
  proxied by Myriad.
</p>

<p>
  You do not need both to set it. If you do not set a prefix or a suffix, it
  will not care what is at the start or end of the message respectively. For
  more examples <a href="#more-proxy-examples">click here</a>
</p>

<p>
  For a more detailed guide on proxying, have a look at the
  <a href="/guide#proxying">proxying section of the user guide</a>.
</p>

<h3 id="reactions">Reactions</h3>
<p>
  When you come across a proxied message, or you have proxied a message, there
  are a few handy reactions you can add to the message for some more
  functionality!
</p>

<p>
  ‚ùå (red X): This reaction will cause the message to be deleted, but only if
  you are using the account that sent the message.
</p>

<p>
  ‚ùì (question mark): This reaction will DM you a message containing details on
  who sent the message, the member that it proxied, and the system it was from.
  When you react with this, you will receive a DM that looks like this:
  <img src="/assets/ExampleQuery.png" alt="Example of a message query" />
</p>

<p>
  ‚ùó (exclamation mark): This reaction will send a message to the channel the
  proxied message was sent in, pinging both you and the sender of the message.
  That message will look like this:
  <img src="/assets/ExamplePing.png" alt="Example of a message query" />
</p>

<h3 id="more-proxy-examples">More proxy examples</h3>
<p>
  How to read these examples: The smaller code block with ‚ÄúExample Message‚Äù in
  it is the message you would like to proxy, the larger code block immediately
  after it is the command you would need to set the member Myriad to respond to
  that proxy
</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">Example message - Myriad</code></p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge">
  <div class="highlight">
    <pre class="highlight"><code>pk;member Myriad proxy text- Myriad
</code></pre>
  </div>
</div>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">M. Example message</code></p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge">
  <div class="highlight">
    <pre class="highlight"><code>pk;member Myriad proxy M.text
</code></pre>
  </div>
</div>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">üé©Example message</code></p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge">
  <div class="highlight">
    <pre class="highlight"><code>pk;member Myriad proxy üé©text
</code></pre>
  </div>
</div>
<p>
  <em>Note: Custom emojis do work, but look a bit weird in the text form</em>
</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">-- Example message --</code></p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge">
  <div class="highlight">
    <pre class="highlight"><code>pk;member Myriad proxy -- text --
</code></pre>
  </div>
</div>
<p>
  <em
    >Note: Having a space between the prefix/suffix and
    <code class="highlighter-rouge">text</code> will mean that the space is
    required. In this example
    <code class="highlighter-rouge">--Example message--</code> will not
    proxy.</em
  >
</p>
