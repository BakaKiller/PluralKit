<h1 id="privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>
  I’m not a lawyer. I don’t want to write a 50 page document no one wants to (or
  can) read. In short:
</p>

<p>This is the data PluralKit collects indefinitely:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Information <em>you give the bot</em> (eg. system/member profiles, switch
    history, linked accounts, etc)
  </li>
  <li>
    Metadata about proxied messages (sender account ID, sender system/member,
    timestamp)
  </li>
  <li>
    Aggregate anonymous usage metrics (eg. gateway events received/second,
    messages proxied/second, commands executed/second)
    <ul>
      <li>
        This is visible on
        <a href="https://stats.pluralkit.me/">https://stats.pluralkit.me/</a>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Nightly database backups of the above information</li>
  <li>
    High-level logs of actions taken on the bot (eg. systems created or deleted,
    switches logged, etc)
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This is the data PluralKit does <em>not</em> collect:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Anything not listed above, including…</li>
  <li>
    Proxied message <em>contents</em> (they are fetched on-demand from the
    original message object when queried)
  </li>
  <li>Metadata about deleted messages, members, switches or systems</li>
  <li>Information added <em>and deleted</em> between nightly backups</li>
  <li>
    Information about messages that <em>aren’t</em> proxied through PluralKit
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  System and member information (names, member lists, descriptions, etc) are
  public by default, and can be looked up by anyone given a system/member ID or
  an account ID. This can be changed using the
  <a href="/guide#privacy">privacy settings</a>.
</p>

<p>
  You can export your system information using the
  <code class="highlighter-rouge">pk;export</code> command. This does not
  include message metadata (as the file would be huge). If there’s demand for a
  command to export that,
  <a href="https://github.com/xSke/PluralKit/issues">let me know on GitHub</a>.
</p>

<p>
  You can delete your information using
  <code class="highlighter-rouge">pk;system delete</code>. This will delete all
  system information and associated members, switches, and messages. This will
  not delete your information from the database backups. Contact me if you want
  that wiped, too.
</p>

<p>
  The bot is <a href="https://github.com/xSke/PluralKit">open-source</a>. While
  I can’t <em>prove</em> this is the code that’s running on the production
  server… it is, promise.
